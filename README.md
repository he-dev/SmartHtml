# SmartHtml

**SmartHtml** is an experimental emerging HTML parser for .NET. It's fast and regex free. There is still a lot to be done but it already can parse some simple html. 

You won't find SmartHtml on NuGet yet but it does not use any external libraries so it can be easily compiled.

**Know Issues**
- It might run into an endless loop in some cases.
